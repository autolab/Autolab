  # since we enforce that a submission's version is immutable, it seems

  # computing it). but this is *not* the case due it opening the possibility of
  # race conditions.
  #
  # in fact, *not* assuming self is the latest submission here is the very
  # reason why this caching works and isn't susceptible to race conditions
  # (such as: someone submits twice quickly in succession and the first
  # update_latest_submission happens after the second).
  #
  # because we actually compute the latest submission in update_latest_submission
  # instead of just using self, we're guaranteed that the latest submission will
  # indeed be cached as such, irrespective of the interleaving. the invariant being
  # that, whatever the interleaving, the last thing that happens will be an
  # update_latest_submission which will atomically compute the latest submission
  # and cache it in the AUD (assessment_user_data).
