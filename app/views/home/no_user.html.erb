Here are some resources to get you started.

<h2>For students</h2>

      <h3>How can I join a course?</h3>
      <p>
      For most types of courses, students can't enroll themselves. Fire off an
      email to your instructor and they can make sure that you get added.

      <h3>I just set up Autolab. How can I make myself an admin?</h3>
      <p>
      We have a Rake task that you can run where your app is deployed to promote
      any user to the admin level. Just run <code>rake
      'promote_to_admin[you@example.com]'</code> to give a user administrative
      priviledges. Note that the user has to exist already.
