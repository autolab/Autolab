    <h3>I have an issue with the way my assignment was graded.</h3>
    <p>
    That's not exactly a question, but you should probably check with your
    professor. They're the ones who can help with regrades, getting grading
    feedback, questions about due dates, and other class-specific details.

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Can you add me to [this class I'm supposed to be in]?</h3>
    <p>
    No, sorry. Once again, you'll have to check with your professor for this one.

    <h3>What should I do if I've encountered an error or if I'd like to request a feature?</h3>

    Jump on over to our <b><a href="https://github.com/mikedrewitt/Autolab/issues/">issue tracker
    on GitHub</a></b>. From there, you can search for already-reported issues (to make
    sure the one you have in mind hasn't already been reported) and then create an
    issue detailing what's wrong or what you'd like to see happen. Make sure to read
    below for what makes a good error report.

    <h3>What makes a good error report?</h3>
    <p>
    When reporting an issue or requesting a feature, please be as descriptive as possible! Good issue reports have
    <ul>
      <li>screenshots</li>
      <li>stack traces (if you saw an error page and it gave you one)</li>
      <li>a description of what you think you did to generate the error</li>
      <li>a description of what you think should have happened</li>
    </ul>
