<h1>Default Scoreboard</h1>
<ul>
  <li><i>Default scoreboard.</i> The default scoreboard displays the
  total problem scores, followed by each individual problem score,
  sorted in descending order by the total score.
</ul>

<h1>Custom Scoreboards </h1>
<ul>
  <li><i>Custom scoreboards.</i> Autograded assignments have the option
  of creating custom scoreboards.  You can specify your own custom
  scoreboard using a JSON <i>column specification</i>.

  <li><i>Column specification.</i> The column spec consists of a "scoreboard"
  object, which is an array of hashes, where each hash
  describes a column. Each hash has a required "hdr:<i>colname</i>"
  element. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Example:</b> Scoreboard with one column, called "Score":
    <br>
    <font color=blue><b><kbd>{"scoreboard": [ {"hdr":"Score"} ] }</kbd></b></font>
  </ul>

  <li><i>Sort order.</i> A custom scoreboard sorts the first three
  columns, from left to right, in descending order. You can change the
  default sort order for a particular column by adding an optional
  "asc:1" element to its hash.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Example:</b> Scoreboard with two columns, "Score" and
    "Ops", with "Score" sorted descending, and then "Ops" ascending:
    <br>
    <font color=blue><b><kbd>{"scoreboard": [ {"hdr":"Score"}, {"hdr":"Ops", "asc":1} ] }</kbd></b></font>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Custom Scoreboard Entries</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The values for each row in a custom scoreboard come directly from
  a "scoreboard" array object in the <i>autoresult string</i>
  produced by the autograder. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Example:</b> Autoresult returning the score (97) for a single autograded
    problem called "autograded", and a scoreboard entry with two
    columns: the autograded score ("Score") and the number of operations
    ("Ops"):
    <br>
    <font color=blue><b><kbd>{"scores": {"autograded":97}, "scoreboard":[97, 128] }</kbd></b></font>
  </ul>
</ul>

<i>Note to CMU instructors:</i> If you are configuring your scoreboard
by overloading functions in the lab.rb file, then the banner and
column specification on the "Admin scoreboard" page will be ignored.
