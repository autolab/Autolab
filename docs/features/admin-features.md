# Admin Features

Features that only admins have access to.

## Reset User's Password

An admin is able to trigger the reset of the student's password by selecting `Manage Users` from the `Manage Autolab` dropdown if a student does not have access to a registered email address and forgets their password. The admin can click on a student from the generated `Users List` and click on `Change User's Password` to reset the student's password.

The admin can either choose to change the student's password on behalf of the student by clicking `here` in the `flash` that appeared or sending the link that was generated in the `flash` to the student so that the student can change their password.
