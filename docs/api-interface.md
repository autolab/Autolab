This page details all the endpoints of the Autolab REST API.

The client's access token should be included as a parameter to all endpoints. For details on obtaining access tokens, please see the [API Overview](/api-overview/).

## Routing

For version 1 of the API, all endpoints are under the path `/api/v1/`. For example, to get user info, send a request to `https://<host>/api/v1/user`.

## Request & Response Format

All endpoints expect the HTTP GET method unless otherwise specified.

All parameters listed below are required unless denoted [OPTIONAL].

All responses are in JSON format.

-   If the request is completed successfully, the HTTP response code will be 200. The reference below details the keys and their respective value types that the client can expect from each endpoint.
-   If an error occurs, the response code will _not_ be 200. The returned JSON will be an object with the key 'error'. Its value will be a string that explains the error.

**Notes on return value types**

All datetime formats are strings in the form of `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD`, e.g. `2017-10-23T04:17:41.000-04:00`, which means 4:17:41 AM on October 23rd, 2017 US Eastern Time.

JSON spec only has a 'number' type, but the spec below distinguishes between integers and floats for ease of use in certain languages.

If a field does not exist, the value is generally null. Please be sure to check if a value is null before using it.

-   submission[file]

    The file to submit

    _Note: the name should be the string 'submission[file]'_

**Success Response:**

| key      | type    | description                                              |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| version  | integer | The version number of the newly submitted submission.    |
| filename | string  | The final filename the submitted file is referred to as. |

**Failure Response:**

A valid submission request may still fail for many reasons, such as file too large, handins disabled by staff, deadline has passed, etc.

When a submission fails, the HTTP response code will not be 200. The response body will include a json with the key 'error'. Its contents will be a user-friendly string that the client may display to the user to explain why the submission has failed. The client _must not_ repeat the request without any modifications. The client is _not_ expected to be able to handle the error automatically.
