## Clearing Tango job queue
Due to faulty configs or other reasons, you may have a large backlog of jobs waiting to run that are stuck. 
Restarting Tango does not solve this issue as the jobs are persisted on a Redis queue. You can drop everything in Redis using the `redis-cli` client as follows:

```bash
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> FLUSHALL
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> 
```
