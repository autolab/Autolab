The installation process comprises installing both Autolab and Tango (the autograding backend). MySQL and Redis will usually also need to be installed in most use cases.

There are 2 different ways to install Autolab and Tango:

  1. The simplest and fastest way to get up and running is to use our [Docker Compose installation](/installation/docker-compose/), which is ideal for most workloads. Both production-ready and testing deployments are available.
  2. You can also [install Autolab and Tango manually](/installation/manual), where we have instructions for Ubuntu 18.04 and Mac OSX 10.11+. 


Most of our users use the Docker Compose installation method as it is simpler, production-ready, and comes deployed with MySQL and TLS.
