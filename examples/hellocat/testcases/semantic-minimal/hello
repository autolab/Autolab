This example shows the minimal JSON string necessary to invoke the semantic feedback layout.

Feedback will have two sections:
 * Raw Output (showing the contents of this file)
 * Score (showing a table with point for "Correctness", "TA/Design/Readability", and their sum)

{"_presentation": "semantic"}
{"scores": {"Correctness": 20, "TA/Design/Readability": 40}}
