This example shows the a JSON string with test data and multiple stages invoking the semantic
feedback layout. The hint provided is very long and designed to help test wrapping.

Feedback will have five sections:
 * Raw Output (showing the contents of this file)
 * Build (showing two 'tests': 'compile' and 'link'--both will have a green check)
 * Test (showing two 'tests'): 'Add Things' and 'Return Values'
   Add Things will have a green check
   Return Values will have a red X and display a hint
 * Timing (showing two scalar values) 'Stage 1 (ms)' and 'Stage 2 (ms)' with values 10 and 20 
 * Score (showing a table with point for "Correctness", "TA/Design/Readability", and their sum)
